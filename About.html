<h1 style="color:white;font-size:60px align="center">About bwlðŸ’™ Site</h1>
<h1 style="color:white" align="center">Itâ€™s natural to have questions and concerns about setting up a website. Cost is a common one. Beyond an up-front fee to design the website, the ongoing costs can be minimal. And considering the long-term benefits a website will provide, the cost to design a good website should be well worth it.
 
Other concerns often relate to a business not being web-oriented or that it wouldnâ€™t sell goods online. The answer to these concerns is that a business website can provide so many more benefits. Establishing trust, strengthening your brand, forging better customer relations, and informing a wider group of people about your businessâ€™s capabilities are all key benefits.
 
Another common concern is that you donâ€™t have much content to add for frequent updates or you donâ€™t have time to blog. The short answer is that you donâ€™t need to. Sure, more activity and frequently refreshed content can generate more interest, but any Web presence is probably better than none. Once you have a basic website, you can always add to it, as your business and resources grow</h1>
